# Torrenting on Public Cloud Survey on Policies and Practices
Over the years, torrenting has been a popular method of gaining access to
media that are often behind paywalls. All the top streaming services available
charge a monthly fee to their users to access movies or music which are
frequently unique to a single streaming provider, forcing viewers to pay
numerous times to watch their favourite series on multiple platforms. This
seems to be one of the speculated reasons behind people torrenting as the
bill can pile up to a sizeable amount. While the use of torrents itself is legal all
over the world, it is often used to illegally download content. This paper
focuses on the misuse of the public cloud to use torrents illegally.<br><br>
The paper will focus on<br>
(1) A complete breakdown of the myths and facts of the BitTorrent protocol
and how it has been used in unlawful practices<br>
(2) A compilation of the research done on regulations and policies set up by
public cloud providers in deterring illegal use of torrents<br>
(3) An experimental study on the actual practical feasibility of detecting the
use of torrents and possible solutions to enable cloud providers to suspend
such activities<br><br>
This project aims to expose how easy cloud providers have made it to use
torrent applications on their servers for unlawful practices. While there may be
laws or policies on their terms of service to prevent such activities, there is no
indication that they are actively attempting to stop it or waiting to receive a
notice from owners of the copyrighted materials that their servers are being
used for said activities at which point the damage has been done.
This is a grey subject with little research, particularly in relation to public cloud
computing. The research is conducted to serve as an awareness and to drive
cloud providers to take stricter actions to minimise misuse of their resources.
